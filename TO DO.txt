add covering element on .elements to create hilight effect

hover .element activates letter hilight

click on .element toggles the hilight to stay on/off

new flip clears all hilights



main button chan change to new 'foo' depending on database:
new Character (disney)
new Animal (animal)
new Color (color)
new Word for everything else

    // TO DO: change the max value of the slider to equal the numeber of characters being displayed

if category is Colors, definition does NOT use first suggested word, 
it only returns def if it's an exact match
make a boolean for 'return exact or nothing'


fix icon ventering in drop down control tabs

make display word match actual searched word.

hilight ALL syllable characters on brace click

styleize select menus for all browsers. Make like rotary dial??

standardize with somethign like this;

Why is getString() called THREE TIMES when unfindable search word entered (e.g., 'derd')
SOLVE THIS


function lookUp(providedWord) needs to be optimized, re-think this logic  



function flipCharacters(ifProvided){ 

    ifProvide is NEVER CALLED in the function?!?!?
